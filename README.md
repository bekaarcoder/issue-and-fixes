- **Sometimes, Apostrophes and double quotes doesn't show up until we press another key**

**Resolution** - Its because the keyboard settings are set to the dead key setting. So to resolve this:-

  1. Check your Keyboard and Language settings. It should not be US-International
  2. If it is US-International, change it to ENG-US.
